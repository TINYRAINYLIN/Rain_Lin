  Hi, my name is **Rain**, and I am a **Master’s student in Data Science at Boston University** with expertise spanning **data analysis, data science, machine learning engineering, and data engineering**. I enjoy working across the entire **data lifecycle**, from **designing and managing data pipelines**, to conducting advanced **statistical and analytical modeling**, to developing and deploying **machine learning systems in cloud environments**. I am motivated to apply these skills in professional settings where rigorous analysis, reliable infrastructure, and impactful model deployment come together.

              This project developed a **hybrid recommendation system** for Amazon electronics using a **multi-stage architecture**. Candidate products were generated with **SVD (Surprise)** for collaborative filtering and **BERT embeddings** for content similarity. **Feature vectors** were engineered by combining **prediction scores**, **sentiment scores (VADER)**, and **product metadata**, which were then ranked with **XGBoost**. The system achieved **Precision@5 = 0.88, Recall@5 = 0.86, and AUC = 0.89**, and performance was further improved through ensembling with **Neural Collaborative Filtering (PyTorch)**. Deployment was completed with a **Streamlit app** on **Hugging Face Spaces**, integrating **MLOps practices** to reduce latency by **20%** and enabling **real-time recommendation exploration**.

          This work involved **processing the Zillow Kaggle dataset** through exploratory data analysis (EDA), missing value handling, and the engineering of **200+ domain-driven features** to enhance predictive accuracy. A variety of regression models were trained and tuned, including Linear, Ridge, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with cross-validation confirming that the **Random Forest model achieved the strongest performance (R² = 0.874, MAE = 10.9k, RMSE = 271k, with 85% of predictions within 10k of actual values)**. To improve interpretability, **SHAP explainability methods** (beeswarm, dependence, waterfall) were applied to identify key drivers of property value. Additional **geospatial insights** were generated using Folium to visualize property trends across regions. The pipeline is being prepared for **deployment as an interactive Streamlit app on AWS**, enabling real-time property valuation and exploration.
